      h2 An New Minisite For An Innovative New Product Line
      p For over 60 years Echo has been a leader in the commercial and home power and outdoor tool market. I was thrilled to be selected to lead the web branding and interactive development initiative for a groundbreaking new line of high-powered 58-volt outdoor tools. Throughout the project, I worked closely with Echo, their exclusive retailer The Home Depot, and manufacturing partner TTI North America. There were multiple brand and marketing stakeholders that presented challenging constraints with regard to placement and size of existing brand logo marks. I worked with the existing Echo brand assets below.

      h2 The Highest Battery Capacity Yet - Launched At A Break-Neck Pace
      p This project ran at a drop-dead sprint because it was imperative that the online marketing materials launch simultaneously with the retail product rollout. Midnight oil was burned; we were able to launch the site two weeks early to allow for additional bugtesting before the product became publically available.
