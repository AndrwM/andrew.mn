      h2.c-title.c-title--large A New Mini-Site for an Innovative, New Product Line
      p.c-paragraph For over 60 years Echo has been a leader in the commercial power and outdoor tool market. I was thrilled to be selected to lead the web branding and interactive development initiative for a groundbreaking new line of high-powered, 58-volt outdoor tools. Throughout the project, I worked closely with Echo; their exclusive retailer, The Home Depot; and manufacturing partner, Torque Creative/TTI North America. There were multiple brand and marketing stakeholders that presented challenging constraints with regard to placement and size of existing brand logo marks. I worked with the existing Echo brand assets below.

      h2.c-title.c-title--large The Highest Battery Capacity Yet&mdash;Launched at a Break-Neck Pace
      p.c-paragraph This project ran at a drop-dead sprint because it was imperative that the online marketing materials launch simultaneously with the retail product rollout. Midnight oil was burned; we were able to launch the site two weeks early to allow for additional testing before the product became publicly available.
