      h2.c-title.c-title--large On-the-Job Injuries Cost Double with Delays
      p.c-paragraph When the client first approached me about designing and implementing the user interface for a web application to help expedite the response times for remote on-the-job injuries, I was immediately interested. The problem? A majority of workers' compensation lawsuits were results of unclear policies, slow communication, and missing accountability.
      p.c-paragraph Our goal was twofold, build a platform to quickly and comprehensively alert the necessary parties when an on-the-job injury had occurred and provide a repository to save and securely share all the necessary information between physicians, managers, lawyers, human resources, insurance managers, and all other stakeholders involved.
