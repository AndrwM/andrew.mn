      h2.c-title.c-title--large On-the-Job Injuries Cost Double with Delays
      p.c-paragraph When the client first approached me about designing and implementing the user interface for a web application to help expedite the response times for remote on-the-job injuries, I was immediately interested. The problem? A majority of workers' compensation lawsuits were results of unclear policies, slow communication, and missing accountability.
      p.c-paragraph Our goal was twofold, build a platform to quickly and comprehensively alert the necessary parties when an on-the-job injury had occurred and provide a repository to save and securely share all the necessary information between physicians, managers, lawyers, human resources, insurance managers, and all other stakeholders involved.

        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium These are the resulting wireframes after weeks of iterations and insurance industry interviews. The application interface was built from these prototypes.

      h2.c-title.c-title--large Developing a Brand Styleguide
      p.c-paragraph With the skeleton of the application interface in place, I began work on the styleguide that would define the brand direction. The only existing brand materials the client had was their logo.

        h3.c-title.c-title--medium Initial Styleguide
        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium While some elements changed slightly as the project progressed, this was the starting point for designing high-fidelity mockups.

      h2.c-title.c-title--large High-Fidelity Mockups &amp; Interactive State Prototypes
      p.c-paragraph Following the approval of the styleguide, I went right to work fleshing out the interface mockups in high-fidelity with various interactive states to ensure I did not paint myself into a corner when it came time to build the interface in code.

        h3.c-title.c-title--medium Login States
        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium One of the application requirements was the ability for users to be assigned to multiple companies. This was addressed in the login process and in the sidebar navigation.

        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium Due to the small screen sizes I for which I needed to design, I opted to use a right drawer to hide and show filtering options when needed.
