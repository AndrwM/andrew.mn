          p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium Newline is the course-work software of The Iron Yard. I worked with fellow designer <a href="https://dribbble.com/jeremiah" class="c-link" target="_blank">Jeremiah</a> to bring a fun and interactive online classroom experience to over 10,000 students with our custom CSS design system. In addition, I built custom interfaces for the Bootstrap-based administrative &amp; content-creation system used by course-writers, campus operations, and admissions. I led design for runnable code blocks, a lightweight browser IDE, learning comprehension assessments, administrative course manager, student manager, and student-instructor messaging.

          p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium From the ground-up we designed, built, and documented a CSS component system with over 50 elements. It allowed anyone on the team to quickly assemble a view. In addition to authoring the design system, I worked in the engineering team in building the front-end for a in-browser IDE and help messaging system.

        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium I designed and led the development of the new TheIronYard.com. The previous iteration of the company's website had dragged to a halt both in codebase update time and page-load due to technical debt accrued since the original launch in 2013. The Iron Yard marketing department brought me in to spearhead the development of a custom front-end CSS framework. This project was a burn and rebuild-from-the-ground-up type of project.
        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium I worked closely with The Iron Yard marketing team to create a CSS system that could support the existing 200+ pages of content in addition to refreshing The Iron Yard's online experience. The framework, based on the ITCSS methodology, was designed and documented to allow the updating of pages and the assembling of layouts to be made by non-technical members of the marketing team. 
        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium Following launch, the website's bounce rate decreased 28.67% and the average session improved by 18.26%. Conversions of visitor to admissions lead increased by 98%! The leadership was thrilled! This project would't have been successful without the excellent designers and data analysts in the marketing team.

        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium In 2015 I was contracted by TTI North America's in-house design agency, Torque Creative, to create an interactive marketing website to showcase a new line of all-electric tools. This project was particularly special to me because Torque gave me access to their in-house photography division. I had autonomy to art-direct the imagery of the products I needed to complete the project.

My client was building a SAAS employee injury management platform to solve the problem. I was brought in as a UX consultant to do design the flow of the application and create a UI design system.

        p.c-paragraph.c-paragraph--sans.c-paragraph--medium I began working with Arkiver when they needed to redesign their filtering interface and several other key views. Following our initial engagement, the founders of Arkiver loved the work and I continued working with them on a retainer basis for 2 years. Through the life of our engagement I designed their user onboarding flow, in-app sharing flow and assisted with the front-end development alongside their engineers.
