              While Iâ€™m not an expert in back-end development, as a self-taught professional Iâ€™m no stranger to digging in further down the tech-stack than is expected of me to build-out infrastructure necessary to support the UI Iâ€™m implementing. Whether its spinning up databases, writing queries, building models or controllers, etc &mdash; I have even built my own Elixir+Phoenix and RoR personal projects from scratch before. This has left me with a well-rounded set of skills especially suited for smaller development teams where some responsibilities can be ambiguous between dsiciplines.
