              My name is Andrew McIntee. Iâ€™m a digital product designer &amp; web-engineer who specializes in building &amp; nurturing design systems.

              Currently my focus is on design systems and the engineering powering user interfaces, and I work with product teams and startups to create efficient and seamless software user experiences. In addition to design and front-end engineering, I also dive onto the server-level to build out modeling or functionality to support the interface needs.

              Having jumped between both design &amp; front-end engineering,
              I am most effective sitting on engineering team as an engineerâ€™s designer or on a design team as a designerâ€™s engineer; a liaison between two core assets of a software development company.
