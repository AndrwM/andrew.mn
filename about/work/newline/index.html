            <p class="c-paragraph">The original Newline Education Platform began as "The Iron Yard Online", an online supplement to The Iron Yard's immersive classroom. The Iron Yard was a high-intensity, immersive programming trade school with 15 locations across US. I worked for The Iron Yard from 2015 through 2017. As a product designer, I shaped the user-flow and feel of the application as directed by the company leadership's vision.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph">The goal of The Iron Yard Online was to provide a centralized store of all class materials. Having a single application and store of all class content allowed us to guarantee the same quality classroom experience to all 15 campuses. In addition, having a central store of all student information all in one application allowed the company to create quality assurance models and run analytics on current and previous classrooms. The data, used to determine the health of campuses and classrooms quarter-over-quarter, became invaluable to the company leadership through my time there.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph">Fellow product designer, <a href="https://dribbble.com/jeremiah" class="c-link" target="_blank">Jeremiah</a> and I, along with direction from the company's CTO Mason Stewart white-boarded the initial concepts and iterated them into high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">Maintaining consistency with The Iron Yard's brand aesthetic was very important in building the version 1. The grey-oriented, responsible-feeling brand at this point, in early 2016, the company had over 3 years of equity invested.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">We began by designing prototypes of a few pages based on the wireframes that everyone on our team had agreed on. After a few prototypes of different pages, that categorically had different user goals, we felt that we were comfortable with the sub-brand we had created. From there we began breaking the layouts apart into elements that could all be designed individually and then reassembled. Our new design system.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">The pages to the right are several of the prototype pages that we developed in building the design system for The Iron Yard Online.</p>

            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">As the The Iron Yard matured and its offering of services expanded from exclusively on-site, immersive education to also a full range of professional training and online education services. As purveyors of the learning software to the company, naturally our team was tasked with retooling The Iron Yard Online to an independent learning platform venture backed by The Iron Yard.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">Newline was born. Our new brand allowed us to experiment with new ways of messaging and interacting with our students that we previously couldn't do under The Iron Yard's stable brand. In addition to a new youthful, energetics aesthetic we also rethought many key user flows based on user behavior that we had collected and observed.</p>
            <p class="c-paragraph c-paragraph--sans c-paragraph--medium">In addition we rethought our interface building process; rather than created full prototypes and disassembling into components that could be rebuilt back into the initial static prototypes we opted to build and style the components as we saw fit and crafted the system around key user interface components of the project.</p>
