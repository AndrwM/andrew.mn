      <h2>On-the-Job Injuries Cost Double with Delays</h2>
      <p>When Jesse first approached me about designing and implementing the user interface for a web application to help expedite the response times for remote on-the-job injuries, I was immediately interested. The problem? A majority of workers' compensation lawsuits were results of unclear policies, slow communication, and missing accountability.</p>
      <p>Our goal was twofold, build a platform to quickly and comprehensively alert the necessary parties when an on-the-job injury had occurred and provide a repository to save and securely share all the necessary information between physicians, managers, lawyers, human resources, insurance managers, and all other stakeholders involved.</p>

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>These are the resulting wireframes after weeks of iterations and insurance industry interviews. The application interface was built from these prototypes.</p>

      <h2>Developing a Brand Styleguide</h2>
      <p>With the skeleton of the application interface in place, I began work on the styleguide that would define the brand direction. The only existing brand materials the client had was the "Z" logo.</p>

      <h2>High-Fidelity Mockups &amp; Interactive State Prototypes</h2>
      <p>Following the approval of the styleguide, I went right to work fleshing out the interface mockups in high-fidelity with various interactive states to ensure I did not paint myself into a corner when it came time to build the interface in code.</p>
