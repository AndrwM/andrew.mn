          <p>I highly recommend Andrew to others needing top quality design work done. Andrew was able to incorporate a powerful set of features in a beautiful and simple user experience. He is open to alternative ways of approaching design problems which is not always a quality found in other designers. As well as being very talented, Andrew is very personable which is why I continue to use him for projects as they arise.</p>

      <h2>Take Back Control of Your Digital ‘Moments’</h2>
      <p>The founders of Arkiver first approached me to provide creative direction and user interface mockups to iterate on their existing user interface. The app was simple in concept. Give users storage for all their internet content (‘moments’) scattered across various social media sites. My job was to prototype how one of these moments would operate across all screen sizes&mdash;providing a consistent experience with any device.</p>

      <h2>Other Interface Elements</h2>
      <p>Throughout our engagement I consulted with Arkiver to prototype more interaction-heavy views for their app. These include login, bulk editing, moment sharing, and user onboarding. This is a selection of a few of the final protypes.</p>
